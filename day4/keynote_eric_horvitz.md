# Q&A

- In the context of LLMs and scientific discovery, how can you ground LLMs in centuries of scientific language?
    - Non-LLM Methods - when to use expensive wet-lab studies vs. inexpensive in-silicon studies (similar for LLM vs. Non-LLM methods). 
    - GPT-4 can be used for drug repurposing 
- Do you think human intellectual abilities will decline given that people can use it to generate essays?
    - We are at an inflection-point that will be recognized in 500 years
    - Next 25-50 years will be recognizable and will be called something
    - You have to wonder what the scribes said when the printing press came out. What is this? How is it going to change our work?
    - I am concerned about education, learning, reflection. 
    - On the topic of essays: the medical board of medical examiners is excited to use this tech, things are changing fast
- ?
    - Use a large scale LLM to probe a small LLM to understand what neurons are being activated
- How do we trust LLMs? In a situation where we don't know and the LLM doesn't know, how do we know we're in this situation?
    - How can these situations be calibrated with probabilities 
    - They can be calibrated with multiple choice questions but in other situations it's not clear
    - In the case where we're not sure if the LLM is correct, use disclosures
    - There are different use cases:
        - Low-stakes: Use them for administrative use cases, doctors doing paper work
        - High-stakes: high-risk surgery
- In human and computer collaboration, do you see the computer being more computer and the human abdicating responsibilities. Some examples: GPS (do not use memory). Do you see a time where there will not be much of a collaboration?
    - Another interesting question about the implication of these technologies of the future of human work and what makes us human
    - There are less medical school graduates going into radiology because of AI (this was 1.5 years ago, this was even before the LLMs). Will LLMs affect people choosing careers?
        - Lawrence: of course
    - Gave a talk at Stanford Medical School last week - will these models be able to see a patient as a whole, mental state, physical state. No, there will always be an incredible a need for humans to touch, human-human care-givers.
    - Let's see what happens in the next 25 years (we should name this period)
- What kind of role do you see national funding agencies? Especially because training an LLM requires resources that is not available to a typical academic.
    -  Recently invited by Senator Warren to speak to 15-20 senators in a closed session, the last question, "What is one thing we should do?" Eric said fund the national AI research resource. Last week Bill Gates went to Congress with the same people. 
    - Just in the last 3-4 months we've seen the power of small models. Use large models to train small models like Orca. He shared these things with Congress.
    - We need to empower our smartest people to supercharge their work and not just limit this to a few companies
- What do you see somethings in 10 years that an AI cannot do?
    - Optimistically, in a world of rising automation, there will be a rise of a human-human, human-touch economy. Understand what it means to be human better. What does he mean by this?
    - Haven't seen genius coming out of these systems. Flashes of insight out of the blue and put it all together. 
    - It's still a mystery to me what will be possible. But what is not a mystery is the human-human interaction that is so important.
- Github copilot: spend more time verifying, type slower, and it interrupts our flow of work. will LLMs impact the way we're using the tools? 
    - Latency is represented in the model as a weight. Suppress recommendations from Copilot because of this latency weight.
    - Github Copilot is a largely bolt on into an existing system. Can we do better with a more insightful design?
    - What does it mean to integrate a powerful into an existing system vs. re-designing the whole system? 
        - One principle is human agency. 
        - Humans should be pilots. 
        - LLMs should be co-pilots.
